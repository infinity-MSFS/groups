The team's primary emphasis on Embraer aircraft stems from a desire to address the lack of high-quality Embraer models in existing flight simulators, particularly to create a top-notch E-Jet experience.\nIn terms of realism, the team has delivered an authentic and immersive experience, surpassing the usability of the stock Asobo aircraft. The projects have been open source internally and are now available as public open source projects for the community to contribute to and improve.\nMoving forward, the team remains open to the possibility of developing E2 or ERJ aircraft, and continues to offer a wide range of liveries for the community to enjoy.
