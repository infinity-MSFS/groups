        "description": "The Ouroboros E-170 is the inaugural freeware rendition of the Embraer E-170, produced by a dedicated and diverse team from around the globe. The passionate group is committed to developing high-fidelity, accessible, and high-performing add-ons for Microsoft Flight Simulator.\nThis project is part of a larger initiative focused on creating a comprehensive lineup of Embraer aircraft for the simulator, including the E170, E175, E190, E195, and the Phenom 100. The team's primary emphasis on Embraer aircraft stems from a desire to address the lack of high-quality Embraer models in existing flight simulators, particularly to create a top-notch E-Jet experience.\nIn terms of realism, the team has delivered an authentic and immersive experience, surpassing the usability of the stock Asobo aircraft. The projects have been open source internally and are now available as public open source projects for the community to contribute to and improve.\nMoving forward, the team remains open to the possibility of developing E2 or ERJ aircraft, and continues to offer a wide range of liveries for the community to enjoy. For further details and updates on the released projects, the community is encouraged to join the Discord server for more information.",
